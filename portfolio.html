                <p><strong>FLASHING LIGHTS WARNING<br></strong>I was the sole developer for this project. This project started as a fan recreation of the system seen in the Interloper web-series. I have two games linked below. The Interloper game is the visual side of development. You can press the ~ key on your keyboard to open the console and type the commands from the web-series to replicate the events seen (though this part is unfinished). The character controller game is a free reign demo of the character controller that's behind the scenes of the Interloper game. The character controller is inspired by the source engine, and is not reliant on the roblox humanoid system. The pistol model in these games was designed by my friend BlokTart. As of right now the game is unfinished. </p>
