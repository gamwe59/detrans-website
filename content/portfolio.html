                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHjKPrDBQKQ?si=7hE9nh8Rxw7C3I1J" title="INTERLOPER in ROBLOX" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p><strong>FLASHING LIGHTS WARNING<br></strong>I was the sole developer for this project. This project started as a fan recreation of the system seen in the Interloper web-series. This project came in two parts. The other part is the next entry. The Interloper game is the visual side of development. You can press the ~ key on your keyboard to open the console and type the commands from the web-series to replicate the events seen (though this part is unfinished). As of right now the game is unfinished. </p>

                <p>I was the sole developer for this project. The character controller game is a free reign demo of the character controller that's behind the scenes of the Interloper game. The character controller is inspired by the source engine, and is not reliant on the roblox humanoid system (means its from scratch). The pistol model in these games was designed by my friend BlokTart. As of right now the game is unfinished. </p>

                <p>I was the sole developer for this project. This project was an open source virtual reality framework for the ROBLOX platform. I'm no longer working on it, but it had reached a publishable state. Unfortunately, the files for the game have been corrupted, lost, or broken by updates. The nature of ROBLOX as a platform means I can't really do anything about that. </p>

                <p>I was the sole developer for this project. This project was for fun mostly. I wanted to recreate a scene that I liked. That's pretty much it I don't know what else to put here. Everything you see in the video was made by me.</p>

                <p>I was the sole developer for this project. This was a framework for a team project that never got made. It's fairly basic, but it works well, and it was my first time trying anything like this. The video shows all the features included.</p>

                <p>I was the sole developer for this project. This project was an attempt to make a game with a friend's prompt. The prompt was something along the lines of "Make a game about cooking where people can mess each other up." That prompt led me to design a fully physics based character controller inspired by my previous VR projects. A physics-based game would leave lots of room for other players to interfere. Unfortunately, the project halted soon after I finished the framework because I realized something like this would be awful to play on ROBLOX. Their servers and networking code sucks.</p>

                <p>I was the sole developer for this project. This project came in two parts. The first part I lost the footage for. Before I made the assets for the video seen here, this project was a shooter/gun framework for multiplayer roblox games. It used spritesheets to display weapons, and 3D UI to display health and ammo. At one point, I decided to make it look like paper. That's what you can see in the video there. That did not last very long, maybe a week or so. After that, the project was abandoned. (Cuz the code was really bad)</p>

                <p>I was the sole developer for this project. This was a short side project I did for fun. I wanted to test seamless player teleportation. Had some fun with it.</p>

                <p>I was the sole developer for this project. The main struggle with this project was the camera. I wanted to design a camera system that would always point there camera where you would want it to be pointed. That way I could free up a thumbstick/hand for more controls. That's what you see here.</p>

                <p>I was the video editor for this project. I also got some camera angles. This was for the webseries ZEROZEROZERO by winterecy. It appeared in the episode 5a.</p>
